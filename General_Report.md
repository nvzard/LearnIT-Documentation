## What is the problem that we are trying to solve?

We lack a good coding culture in our college. Majority of the students are more inclined towards cultural events because of the lack of good technical events. Due to this reason, the technical community of my college lacks very behind when compared to that of other communities. This lack of interest in the fellow students leads to less motivation and learning enthusiasm which also affects their overall development and placements of college as the students are less skilled.

I feel that the shared struggles with our community are the lack of awareness and guidance about what they need to do in order to develop in terms of their skill, knowledge and as well as career.

## What is the mission of club LearnIT?

The main aim of this club is to make students skilled in their respective field of interest, so that can perform well at the time of placements and be capable enough to develop on their own.


## What do members look to get from our club?

### Activities

The activities that I foresee to help run our club include the mentorship program, placement training, hackathons, workshops, talks from experienced speakers and interactive informative sessions where students can be made aware of the path they need to follow in order to get the desired careers. Also, an online community platform (Slack/Gitter) will be available to students so that they can interact with each other as well as seek guidance if needed.

### Communication

The communication will include messaging in students groups on chat application like Whatsapp/Telegram. I would like to connect with all people in the community through online platforms like Gitter/Slack to make communication efficient.

## What does your community look like once it's shared struggles are solved?

Once the shared struggles are solved, I foresee a community which is growing, developing and self-sustaining. A community which can solve its problems on its own. A community which can help and guide the ones in need i.e. freshers or others peer in my campus. I also believe that the community will solve real-life problems through which its members can learn a lot and grow themselves while doing their part for the society.

### How will our community will be able to stay in contact?
The community members will communicate regularly through online chat platforms and bi-monthly meetups. Apart from this, the members will often meet in-person at special events like workshops and seminars that the community will organize.

### What activities does this club run to keep people coming back for more?
The club will always give recognition to its members who deserve it. The main goal is to help its members become personalities which are able to inspire and motivate others to be like them and to develop themselves. The need for becoming better and skilled will drive people coming back for more.

## What are the different activities we'll need to do to solve our community's shared struggles?

I believe that a community will grow when each and every member of the community grows individually. The activities that I propose in order to achieve this are as follows:
- Get to know personal goals, dreams, and problems of every individual and guide them towards a path which might help them get closer to where they want to be. This can be done to personal meetups as well as through online messaging services.
- Get acquainted with the struggles that the majority is facing and address it through workshops and seminars.
- Equip the members with tools so that they can solve their own problems in the future and also help others as well. The tools here refer to self-determination and confidence which the members will get after they solve their own problems and achieve their goals. This will also ensure the future growth and self-sustenance of the community/
- Assign projects to members under the mentorship program based on individual interests and need. This will result in self-development as well as an increase in the skills of the students.
- Document all the problems faced by individual members and the community with their solutions and make it publicly available so that everyone can learn from them.

## Future-proofing of our community

### Agency
I would like to let people of the community volunteer themselves for tasks which interest them and to come up with ideas and projects that the community should work over. I would also like them to vote for important events which they think should be conducted out of all the other event ideas.

### Mission
I would define this report as a general reference document and share it with the with the community members by making it available publicly for future references. I would make it sure that it is accessible by all at all times.

### Structure
I would like to adopt a structure where everyone has the power to make decisions. I would future-proof the community by letting the existing members volunteer for roles. I'd like the higher organizing positions to be handed over to the juniors by a group decision of the existing members of the organizing community through mutual voting. I'd also the new leaders to be mentored by the existing leaders for ensuring that the power is in the right hands.
